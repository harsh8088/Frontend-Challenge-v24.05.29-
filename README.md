<h3 align="left">CSS Art: June</h3>

Draw what comes to mind for you when it comes to the month of June. Depending on where you live, perhaps that’s the summer solstice or a transition to falling leaves and winter. Or maybe it is Father’s Day or Pride Month.

Whatever comes to mind when you think of June, please show us!

How to submit
All CSS Art submissions should, at minimum, explain what you are creating, how you approached the project, and the code you crafted either shared as a public link or directly embedded in your post.





<h3 align="left">Glam Up My Markup: Beaches</h3>


Use CSS and JavaScript to make the below starter HTML markup beautiful, interactive, and useful. We have provided a starter template of a site that lists the best beaches in the world and some information about each one. Since the template does not include photos, you may need to get creative in how you might make it visually appealing.

Your submission should be more fun and interactive than the HTML we provide, but also be usable and accessible. You should not directly edit the HTML provided, unless it is via JavaScript. We expect style and substance. You may add basic boilerplate, including meta tags etc. for presentation purposes.


How to submit
All Glam Up My Markup submissions should, at minimum, explain what you built with a demo of the project via a public link or directly embedded in your post.
